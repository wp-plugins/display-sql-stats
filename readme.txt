Displaying SQL result data as graphical chart on the dashboard with use of Google Chart Tools.

== Installation ==
1. Upload plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder
2. Activate the plugin
3. Edit/Insert SQL Stament in Settings
4. Watch in dashboard

== Remove plugin ==

1. Deactivate plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Delete plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It's best to use the build in delete function of wordpress. That way all the stored data will be removed and no orphaned data will stay.
